					<h3 class="major">First Travels</h3>
					<p>
						In the early summer of 2025 I decided to finally get out of my comfortzone and go traveling. <br/>
						I booked flights and hotel on a small island in Greece, and hoped for the best. <br/>
						This is the legend of my journey. 
					</p>
					<h3>May 25th</h3>
					<p>
						I want to travel, and have been talking about it for ages. But I am too scared to do anything about it. Or so I have been telling myself, at least. 
						But the fear has to end. I have to stop sabotagig myself at every corner. <br />
						I started looking at trips adn found something interesting, through the senior sosciety I am supporting. <br />
						I had my reservations about taking a trip with seniors, but it looked interesting. Flights, hotel and trips on the island, all booked in one easy sweap. <br />
						I decided to go for it. Can't be worse than sitting at home, doing fuck all. 
					</p>
					<h3>May 26th</h3>
					<p>
						The travel agency called. They wanted to make sure I was aware that the trip is meant for seniors (50+), so they were wondering if it is the right choice for me, and they offered to refund me, if I changed my mind. <br />
						I have been thinking about it most of the day, and maybe it isn't the right choice for me? It would be pretty easy to call and get my money back<br/>
						Many considerations and looking at alternative travels later, I have decided I need to go. Since I didn't find a better trip to book, I am sticking with what I already ordered. I'm going to Greece, and I'm going to get teh best possible trip out of it.
