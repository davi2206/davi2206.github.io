Don't we all have a small dream of joining, or even better, starting a secret organization? A group of people who has secrets and a common mission. And maybe even a secret handshake!

I always dreamt of that, and over the years I have toyed with the idea and tried to come up with a reason to get it done. But I always came up short. No one would want to join a secret organization that has no goals, no rules and no purpose. I never managed to answer the most important question people would ask before joining: Why?

Now I am trying to get this website somewhat active, and even start giving out challenges, projects and missions that you, the reader, can take on yourself. <br>
To make this a good experience, we would need a place to hang out and talk. A place where you can submit your entries, solutions or results from various tasks and challenges. <br>
That is why I have created a Discord server, where all of this is possible. I present to you: 

## The League of Silence!
The server will have several different areas that you can participate in, depending on your own preferences. Obviously we will have a general chat area, where we can talk about anything you like. We will also have an area for creative writing, both short stories and poetry, and possibly other categories, if needed. <br>
There will be an area dedicated to reflections. This could be spiritual talks, existential rants or pondering about the world. It will also include a space where you can open up about personal issues or concerns, as well as help others who need someone to talk to. A safe space, for talking about the hard or difficult parts of life. 

The Forge will be an area for things you create. A space to showcase anything from knitting, to metal forging. From leather working, to woodcarving. From painting, to clay sculpting. From photography, to candle painting. Really, anything you make can be shown here. <br>
And obviously there will be a section dedicated to missions, challenges, tasks and trials, that you can participate in, and submit your own work for. I have a few different plans already: A 30 day writing challenge, where you write something everyday for 30 days. A photography session, where you take photos of predefined things or topics. An exercise challenge, to get in better shape. <br>
The possibilities are endless. 

To be a part of all this, you can join the Discord server with **[this link](https://discord.gg/9Cxpyz5K36)**. <br>
Anyone is welcome to join the server and become a member of the League of Silence. All I ask is that you behave yourself, and treat everyone there with respect and kindness. 

## The Secret Society
Right now, you may be thinking that The League of Silence doesn't seem much like a secret society. Especially since I am writing an article about it, on a publicly available website, and sharing a link to join it. To some extend you are right. But what if there was a different level og membership? A society within the society? A group of select people, who took on more challenges than everyone else, and got to be part of something more? <br>
Of course there is no such thing. Because that would be stupid and juvenile, and it wouldn't make sense to talk about it here. No one would even want to join such an inner circle. It would just be a handful of people, having maybe one or two extra channels in the server, with little to no chatter. <br>
There probably wouldn't be any extra perks to joining the inner circle, and the process to join would most likely be long and convoluted, and require the completion of a series of seemingly random and senseless tasks. <br>
Since the inner circle wouldn't have any common goals, like making the world a weirder place, there would be no benefit to joining it. Really, don't bother to ask about it.
