## The Campfire
Gather round. Join us, as we tell stories about our adventures, and fairytales about the worlds we can only dream of. <br>
Here we share our workings and our struggles. Grand stories, anecdotes and tall tales. <br>
Anything goes; weather we are spinning gold, or spinning yarn. 

## As the circle grows
More stories, projects and articles will be shared here. I already have a list of topics I may explore and titles I may write out and post here.

The stories will include recordings of my travels through the world, like when I got lost in Sweden, with no money. <br>
The projects will include different algorithms I try to implements in JavaScript or Python, as well as leather workings and writing journeys. <br>
The articles will include spiritual explorations and personal recommendations. 

**Excerpts of ideas list:**
- Lost in Sweden, travel story
- The Pretty Becks Project, gardening adventure
- A-Star algorithm, JavaScript programming
- Four seasons (Four posts), Spiritual and intellectual essays
- I Love You - And 1,000 other lies I told today, Not even sure what category this is?
- Wave Function Collapse, Python programming

If I am a good boy, I will remember to post on my social channels when posting here, so you have a chance to follow allong.
