## The Campfire
Gather round. Join us, as we tell stories about our adventures, and fairytales abot the worlds we can only dream of. <br>
Here we share our workings and our struggles. Grand stories, anecdotes and tall tales. <br>
Anything goes; weather we are spinning gold, or spinning yarn. 

## As the circle grows
More stories, projects and articles will be shared here. I already have a list of topics I may explore and titles I may write out and post here.

The stories will include recordings of my travels through the world, like when I got lost in Sweeden, with no money. <br>
The projects will include different algorithms I try to implements in JavaScript or Python, as well as leatherworkings and writing journeys. <br>
The articles will include spiritual explorations and personal recommendations. 

**Excerps of ideas list:**
- Lost in Sweeden, travel story
- The Pretty Becks Project, gerdening adventure
- A-Star algorithm, JavaScript programming
