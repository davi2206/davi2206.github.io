The project is over. This is a short followup, on the things I meant to get done. 

## The Projects
I was planing on getting some reading done, and although I did read a bit, I didn't find enough time and energy for it, during November. However, I have started reading almost every evening since, and I am hoping to stick to that habit, going forward. <br>
The exercise is a similar story. I didn't dedicate much time to work out during the project month, but many of the projects I did complete involved some moving around, and moving things around. So even though I didn't specifically exercise, I did work up a sweat most days. <br>
Since the project I have been trying to do just a few minutes of lifting heavy things most days. Just to work the old carcase a little bit. <br>
_Mandatory_ Physical Self Improvement. 

### Businesses
**Books**<br>
I got my library cleaned, and have set a bunch of books and other things for sale, mostly on Vinted. I still have more books I could sell, and I am planing on getting them uploaded 'soon'. 

**Side Hustle**<br>
I looked into the ideas I had for printable designs to sell on Etsy, and I still think the idea is viable. However, I didn't create the actual products, and I didn't start a shop or any other side hustle. The question is, do I want it enough, if I can't even find time for it, when I have a full month off work?

### Writing
**Website Content** <br>
I wrote some. Not enough. I was hoping to have scheduled posts to go live every 3-4 days for the rest of the year. The reality is I have nothing scheduled. I am writing the posts and publishing them right away, never getting ahead of the curve. <br>
I did post several articles, but most of them were old posts, from my previous website or things i already had ready. I didn't write anywhere near as much as I was planing in November. 

**30 Shitty Short Stories** <br>
I wrote one story for the book. Plan was to write maybe three or four stories, and edit some of them as well. I didn't do that. <br>
I'm still hoping to publish the book eventually. It will just take quite a while to get there. <br>
I did come up with a few ideas for the artwork, but I haven't commissioned it yet. I tried to create it myself, but I am not sure it is good enough. 

### Cleaning. A lot.
**The Piles**<br>
I managed to clean up everything in the living room, office and library, both on the floor and on the tables. But cleaning up one room always seems to clutter another. I have kept the office and library fairly clean, but the living room has become a parking spot for all the things I still haven't decided where to put yet. It is not nearly as bad as it was, but it is also not perfect.

**The Digital**<br>
I deleted a lot of things from my X: drive, where I keep my software projects and repositories, as well as added a few notes on some of the projects about what to do next with them. <br>
I also managed to get through all my notes and to-do lists, and delete a lot of things that were not that important (I hope). I have a Trello board for my notes and to-do lists. It previously had something like 12 different lists, and well over 100 cards. Now it has five lists and 28 cards. The note app on my phone has gone from 100+ entries to 6. <br>
The "today.txt" file I have had on my computer for years, to hold important notes on things I need to handle ASAP has been deleted. It had about 150 notes in it. They are now deleted, or added to Trello, as actionable tasks. 

Another big task was updating all my online accounts, to get away from my old hotmail, because it is getting too much spam. And it has my name in the address, which I am not happy about, to be honest. <br>
I have updated well over half of the accounts. Some of them take a long time to do, and some of them has just been deleted. There is still work to do on that, but now I will do a handful of accounts semi-daily until it is all done. It might take a few months to get through all of them, but I got a good start on that. <br>
In the same sweep I am updating all my passwords. Many of them were too short or reused. Now all my accounts will have long unique, passwords. Finally. 

**The Windowsills and such**<br>
I managed to clean up all my windowsills, shelves, kitchen drawers and cabinets. Now everything is neat, and clean. <br>
I ended up emptying my entire kitchen to deep clean the cabinets and drawers. It took a while longer than planned, but it was well worth it. And of course a lot of stuff never made it back into the kitchen, but was thrown or given away instead. <br>
The only windowsill that has a clutter now, is in my office, because I have stacked the books I need to upload to Vinted there. That will be cleared over time, as I get them sold. 

**The Garage && Shed**<br>
This was a big one. I spent two full days, emptying the sheds and clean them. Then sorting everything, packing in boxes and stacking it all on the shelved. <br>
Everything was carefully considered if it should be saved or not, and a lot of stuff ended up getting sold and thrown away. Now everything is perfect, and I can see the floor of the shed! <br>
The garage is still a mess though. I didn't get around to cleaning that properly. In my defense, most of the stuff in the garage can be sorted in two categories: 
1. Things that are already in boxes and on shelves
2. Trash that I need to take to the recycling station, when I have the time, and a trailer to take it on. 

Because of this I am not too worried about it. It looks worse than it really is, and one trip with a trailer, and it will be 90% cleared out. 


## The Conclusion
I am happy I did this project. I didn't do nearly all the things I was hoping to get done, but I was fairly productive, compared to my normal energy levels, and juggling the parts of life I couldn't put on hold. <br>
I am very exited about the things I did get done, and I feel I have gotten some perspective on some of the projects that I didn't manage to get much work in on. <br>
I am thinking this might be something I should do more often. Maybe make The November Project a yearly thing? Although it is somewhat expensive to take a month off work. 

Whatever I decide to do in the future, I am happy I got this opportunity now, and I am grateful for the privilege that it is to do this.
