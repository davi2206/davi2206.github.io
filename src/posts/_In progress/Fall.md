As the light fades, and it gets colder, wetter. 
Fog, melancholy. 
Frost at night, warm by day
You can feel it, hear it, small it. Ruffling in the leaves. Wet grass. Spiritual chill through the bones. 



## How it makes you feel
### What is does to your spirit

My personal experience, on how fall is good for me. 
The brown, melancholy, cozy
Coming of the dark
