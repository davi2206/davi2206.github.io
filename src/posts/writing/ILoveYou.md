summary: "A teaser for a book I will never write"
---
An autobiography about how one person can manipulate his way into people’s lives, with little to no regard for their feelings and well-being. 
In this rudely self-centered, half fiction, half fact, comedy, romance, thriller; author [name_redacted] gives us a peek into the darkness that is his everyday life. 
In an attempt to push people away, while trying to fight loneliness, the lines between true and false, fact and fiction, promises and lies, all become very blurry. 
The heartbreaking stories and painfully mundane anecdotes are mixed in with tall tales of grand adventures. And at no point can you tell exactly where the biography ends, and the fairy tales begin. 
So, strap in, and grab a box of tissues, because you just entered the biggest emotional roller coaster, in the world of literature.
