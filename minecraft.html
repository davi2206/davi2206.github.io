					<h2>The Decree</h2>

				<h3>1. Use common sense</h3>
				<p>This server is a safe and fun place for everyone. If you are not contributing to that, you are doing something wrong</p>
				
				<h3>2. Do as you are told, when you are told</h3>
				<p>If someone asks you to change your behavior, respect them, and do as instructed.<br>
					No one will be giving out orders, but if someone feels the need to comment on your behavior or actions, you might be doing something wrong.<br>
					See rule #1</p>
				
				<h3>3. No second chances</h3>
				<p>If you fail to comply with rules #1 and #2, you are not a good match for our community, 
					and we suggest you find another server to play on. We will not be responding nor reacting to requests to lift a ban</p>

					<h2>Domains</h2>
				</header>

				<p>There are several different areas to explore on the server. Some you may know, and some are specific to NorthLore. Each has it's own charm. </p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-4 col-12-mobile">
						<article class="item">
							<a class="image fit"><img src="minecraft/images/world.png" alt="" /></a>
							<header>
								<h3>World</h3>
							</header>
							<p>The regular overworld, where you can live, build farm, mine and create communities. Here you can have a home, and play the game as it was intended</p>
							<p>Protection stones are available to claim land with /kits</p>
						</article>
						<article class="item">
							<a class="image fit"><img src="minecraft/images/crea.png" alt="" /></a>
							<header>
								<h3>Creative</h3>
							</header>
							<p>For all your creative and artistic needs and projects. You cannot claim land here, but everyone are expected to respect eachothers creations in all the domains</p>
						</article>
					</div>
					<div class="col-4 col-12-mobile">
						<article class="item">
							<a class="image fit"><img src="minecraft/images/nether.png" alt="" /></a>
							<header>
								<h3>The Nether</h3>
							</header>
							<p>When the World gets too boring, you can go to the Nether to have a challenge, or look for treasure, that is not available in the overworld</p>
							<p>Protection stones can be used here, if you want a less hospitable home</p>
						</article>
						<article class="item">
							<a class="image fit"><img src="minecraft/images/adventure.png" alt="" /></a>
							<header>
								<h3>Adventures</h3>
							</header>
							<p>A world of adventure challenges. Here are mazes, parkour, drop-maps.. And such</p>
							<p>At least thats the plan. Not much is built there yet. Please remind me to update the world and this description if I forget</p>
						</article>
					</div>
					<div class="col-4 col-12-mobile">
						<article class="item">

								<h3>The End</h3>
							</header>
							<p>No one has ever gone here, so we don't know for sure what is there. Rumours say dragons, but that seems unlikely, even for us</p>
							<p>You cannot use protection stones here. Nothing is protected here</p>
						</article>
						<article class="item">
							<a class="image fit"><img src="minecraft/images/experimental.png" alt="" /></a>
							<header>
								<h3>Experimental</h3>
							</header>
							<p>This is where we started, when we were setting up things. We have kept the world as a place where we can test everything from railways to TNT contraptions</p>
							<p>You cannot claim land here, and nothing is safe, as The Scribs may blow up the world, if he gets bored</p>
